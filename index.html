<p>A black hole can't really be considered a physical object, nor can it be cut, moved, or altered in any way that can be done to any physical item. There isn't exactly a clear picture of what a black hole looks like but the best description could be that a black hole is merely a "hole" in the fabric of space. Thus giving it the name "black hole". <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/BH_LMC.png/220px-BH_LMC.png"></p>
